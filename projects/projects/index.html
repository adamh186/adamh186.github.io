This portal allowed development teams to use a mono-repo approach for creating new interfaces for end users. In addition to increasing the speed-to-market for UI development, it also better aligns the frontends with the backend microservices. The end deliverable was created as a Progressive Web App (PWA) with fully automated CI/CD. The Automated CI/CD pipeline included testing, code compilation and repository storage, compliance management, and code deployment to PaaS.</p><h2 id=ephemeral-environments><strong>EPHEMERAL ENVIRONMENTS</strong></h2><p>Used IaaS as code to provision and deploy application to temporary environments. The short lived environments cut the IT chargeback cost of the impacted companies from 15-33%. VMs were provisioned using Terraform, databases were done through Jarvis, and all provisioning was handled over a CI/CD pipeline in Jenkins or GitHub Actions.</p><h2 id=spring-boot><strong>SPRING BOOT</strong></h2><p>Created an application using Spring Boot, Gradle, and Oracle Coherence that allows several systems to centralize their data to an in-memory data grid. This is a pivotal application for creating an event driven environment. Not only has this allowed centralization of production data, but it has also decreased the load on the database while significantly increasing front end performance.</p><h2 id=azure-analytics-environment><strong>AZURE ANALYTICS ENVIRONMENT</strong></h2><p>I was able to lead the team through trade-off analysis of various solutions to come up with a cloud-based analytics environment. An iterative approach allowed us to balance the needs of the business with the workload on the IT teams. Using Oracle Golden Gate to replicate data across various disparate systems to a central Oracle RAC database, we were able to centralize data for use in an analytics environment. Once the data was in a central location, we used various Azure tools to provide the key decision makers with a self-service analytics environment.</p><h2 id=vendor-management><strong>VENDOR MANAGEMENT</strong></h2><p>I have worked as the Technical Lead supporting FedEx in several integration projects. In this role, I have worked with the vendor teams to help keep their applications compliant with FedEx Open Source Software (FOSS) guidelines. In addition to the FOSS compliance, I have ensured our ecosystem remain flexible for future integrations should vendors change.</p><h2 id=strategic-architecture-lead><strong>STRATEGIC ARCHITECTURE LEAD</strong></h2><p>As a solutions architect, I have been the lead on many projects on different cross functional teams. In this role, I have had the opportunity to steer the overall IT direction and set a path for modernization. Modernization is crucial for a company that has roots to mitigate risk and decrease technical. The team can increase speed-to-market, realize victories, and keep up on the latest and greatest technologies with a clear vision and path for modernization.</p></div><div class=post-footer><div class=info></div></div></div></div></div></main></div><footer class="footer footer--base"><div class=by_farbox><ul class=footer__list><li class=footer__item>Hugo site with anatole theme
